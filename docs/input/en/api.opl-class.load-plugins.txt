----

Loads the plugins stored in all of the `pluginDir` directories. The directories are scanned only once, to create a temporary PHP file which loads the rest. The file is saved in `pluginDataDir`. If `pluginAutoload` is **true**, the plugin directories are scanned for modifications. If there are any new plugins, the temporary file is rebuilt.

In order to create a support for plugins in your library, you have to implement the `Opl_Class::_pluginLoader()` method.
